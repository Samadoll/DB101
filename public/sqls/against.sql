INSERT INTO `Against` VALUES (40, 154, "Zac heals from the goo that separates from him. You can crush the goo pieces by stepping on them. Kill all of Zac's bloblets when he splits apart to stop him from reforming. Silences, stuns, roots and knockups will all interrupt Zac when he is charging Elastic Slingshot.");
INSERT INTO `Against` VALUES (117, 164, "Camille's shield only works against one damage type, so hit her when she's vulnerable to your damage. The Hextech Ultimatum has a very short range to cast, so try to flash away from her before she gets close.");
